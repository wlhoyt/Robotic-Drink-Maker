# Robotic Bartender/ Drink Maker
This is a hobby project that me and my roommate from college wanted to make in our free time.
Currently the project has been put on hold since we have had been busy with our work/school life.
My job with the robot is to work on the software behind the robot while he works on the electrical 
systems behind it. 
We have a idea of what the robot will look like however, until the initial prototype begins they are just
ideas.
Although the initial idea was to create a wireless robotic bartender for our apartment, it will eventually 
be configured to also do non-alcoholic drinks like a smoothie or Starbucks' refreshers drinks for a more 
general use case.

# My Initial Responsibilities (Before Prototyping)
- [ ] Set up Google Home custom commands (Should be about three commands: One for the initial call, second for the order(s), third for confirmation)
- [ ] Set up a database to store drink recipes (Later to be converted or placed in a higher hierarchy above General Purpose Input Outputs) 
- [ ] Set up a database to store GPIO Pins to be populated later on during prototyping
- [ ] Write a network connection program for the Google Home and the Raspberry Pi (Robot's CPU)
- [ ] Test the Raspberry Pi to see if it correctly receiving the orders and codes

# My Robotic Responsibilities
- [ ] Creating the code to move the motor to the correct location based of the GPIO code the robot recieved
- [ ] Creating the code to activate the mechanism to release the fluid into the cup
- [ ] Create a notification that either from the Google Home or the robot itself 

# Other Ideas for the Robot 
Thank you JLabs for the ideas and feedback about the idea during one of my interview. That was a interesting end to my interview and thanks for 
being patient with me about what I am working on as a project.
- [ ] Create a app to use as a way to communicate and place orders to the robot (This should be relevantly easy since I have experience with app
development using android studio and it's connection to the Firebase database.)
- [ ] Create a webpage to use the app from (This idea is a little harder to accomplish since I dont want to have a server up on a webpage all the time)
- [ ] Add machine learning to the robot
This last point would either be a ML Algorithm tied to Food Network or some sort of drink site where you can get trending drink ideas from and the robot
would check if it has a way to make it with the ingredients it knows. I would probably add a alert to the Google Home to notify the user that a new drink 
has been added to the database and a way to let the user know what the drink includes.
